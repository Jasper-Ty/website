I typed up some notes on the *fundamental theorem of calculus*. Why? I had to. Well, I thought I had to. I completely misunderstood what was asked of me for an interview. I'm not letting my efforts go to waste, though, so I figured my website should have *one more thing in it*.

$$
f(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \int_a^x f(t)dt
$$
