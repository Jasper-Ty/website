I have some incomplete notes on a proof of this identity due to Jacobi (in his Fundamenta nova theoriae functionum ellipticarum).

$$
\prod_{n=1}^\infty(1-x^n)^3 = \sum_{k=0}^\infty(-1)^k(2k+1)x^{k(k+1)/2} 
$$

My proof is sound, but the machinery is missing (why is the substitution I make valid?). Darij, my instructor for this class, told me to take a look at the article [*Formal Laurent series in several variables*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exmath.2013.01.004) by Monforte.

I did a first pass through it, and I think I have a good handle on it. The last thing I need to do now is to understand when substitution induces a continuous map, which I need to *really* confirm that the substitution is valid.

I also need to cut down on the confusing indices.
