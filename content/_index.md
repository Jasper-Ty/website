## About
I'm a Mathematics Ph.D student at Drexel University.
I did Computer Engineering at Drexel as well for my undergrad.

I program and study *a lot* of math in my free time, and I also love to draw and produce music. 
I have a Pi 4 and two Arduino Mega 2560's which I do hobby electronics with.

I'm a fairly good Minesweeper player.
