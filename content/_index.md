## About
I'm a Computer Engineering graduate and an incoming Mathematics Ph.D student at Drexel University.

I program and study *a lot* of math in my free time, and I also love to draw and produce music. 
I have a Pi 4 and two Arduino Mega 2560's which I do hobby electronics with.

I'm a fairly good Minesweeper player. I'm currently ranked #413 on the [Authoritative Minesweeper](https://minesweepergame.com/world-rankings.php) rankings.
